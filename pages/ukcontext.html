<h2>Energy Overview</h2>

<p>Before we dive into the hourly energy model for households this section provides a little context about how we use energy at present in the UK. How much of that energy is attributed to households and by end use. This section then breifly summarises the main power down energy solutions that are both advocated by ZeroCarbonBritain and David MacKay's Sustainable Energy Without the hot air.</p>

<p><a href="http://withouthotair.com/">David MacKay's energy stack style graphics</a> are used here and the units of kWh per day per person to visualise the energy quantaties.</p>

<p><b>The UK Energy use context 2012</b></p>

<p>The energy stacks on the right show the statistics for energy use in the UK in 2012.</p>

<p>The first stack shows the total energy use, which is similar to the total amount that David MacKay mentions in his book.</p>

<p>The second stack shows the breakdown by sector and the third reallocates losses to their respective sectors, giving a more true picture of each sectors contribution.</p>

<p>The fourth stack shows energy by end use highlighting the large contribution of space heating, transport and energy losses in thermal power stations. All of which have significant solutions that both reduce the amount of energy required for the same level of thermal comfort and transportation and then allow for their electrification and supply from renewable electricity.</p>

<p><b>Energy used for each sector broken down by type of use</b></p>

<p>This second series of energy stacks on the right break down energy use in each sector by end use. Left to right the stacks are: Services, Industry and Domestic. It shows clearly both the relatively large consumption of energy directly attributable to households and the large contribution of space heating demand, transport and losses associated with generating electricity in thermal power stations.</p>

<p>The energy quantities are in kWh per day per person and assumes the UK average household occupancy of 2.34. The values in the household stack can be multipled by 2.34 to obtain the total household energy use. 14.2 kWh/d for space heating per person x 2.34 x 365 days in a year = 12128 kWh space heating demand, if we then add in the water heating demand the total would be 15117 kWh. The average UK household gas bill is around 13500 kWh.</p>

<p>The hourly energy modelling described in the following pages will focus to begin with on the household energy stack. Making the quantity of energy discussed relatable to energy quantities that we are more familiar with in our bills and driving habits.</p>

<div style="clear:both"></div>

<pre>
Space heating (end use) accounts for 19.5% of total primary energy, or 28.6% 
of end use energy.

Building services (space heating, water heating, lighting & appliances and cooking) 
make up 30% of total primary energy, or 44.1% of end use energy.

Transport (end use) accounts for 26.3% of total primary energy, or 38.5% of end use
energy.

The sources of non transport losses are: Losses in distribution: 5%, 
Used by energy industry: 23%, Thermal power station losses: 72%

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p>The following highlights some of the main solutions that significantly increasing the efficiency of our energy use so that the remaining energy demand can be provided by sustainable energy sources.</p>

<h3>Better building fabric and better heating</h3>

<p>Substantial end use energy savings can be made by improving the building fabric of our housing, including insulation measures, air-tightness and better glazing. The state of the art that demonstrates what is possible is the building standard called <a href="http://www.passivhaus.org.uk/">passivhaus</a> that orginated from Germany, buildings built to this standard can typically use 90% less energy to heat than is currently the norm in the UK. Passivhaus buildings are also very comfortable buildings with designed stable internal temperatures of 21C.</p>

<table class="table">
<tr><td><b>An average UK house now</b></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Floor area:</td><td>85m2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Space heating demand:</td><td>12284 kWh/year</td></tr>
<tr><td>Space heating demand per m2:</td><td>145kWh/m2.year</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Primary energy demand:</td><td>28475 kWh/year</td></tr>

<tr><td>Primary energy demand per m2:</td><td>120 kWh/m2.year                     64% reduction on 2012 average house</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Not all buildings have to achieve passivhaus standard for a zero carbon energy system to work, CAT's Zero Carbon Britain scenario applies an average space heating demand reduction of 50-60% taking into account the variation and complexity of the housing stock where new buildings predominatly achieve near passivhaus standard and older buildings to a lesser degree.</p>

My Home Energy Planner

To calculate the energy savings potential of your own house you can use the SAP 2012 building energy model available 
here that we have been developing with Carbon Coop.

<p><b>Heating systems</b><br>
There are two main types of heating systems that can be zero net carbon: heatpumps powered by zero carbon electricity and biomass from well managed forests (including biomass CHP). A well designed heatpump installation can deliver 3-4 units of heat output for every 1 unit of electrical input significantly reducing the electrical energy input required to supply heating demand over a direct electric heater. The resource availability for biomass is limited for heating on a large scale and can compete with land for agriculture if not thought out properly.</p>

<p>A house that starts with a space heating demand of 40 kWh/d achieves a 70% reduction in space heating energy demand through better insulation and draught proofing, the new space heating demand is 12 kWh/d. This could then be supplied by a heatpump requiring just 4 kWh/d of primary energy demand from renewable sources. A total energy saving of 90%.</p>

<h3>Electric transport</h3>

<p><b>Electric cars: 80% less energy</b><br>
Amazing efficiency gains are also possible in transportation. A typical petrol car uses around 80 kWh to travel 100km. An electric car such as the nissan leaf, zoe or tesla uses only a fraction of this amount to travel the same distance around: <a href="http://withouthotair.com/c20/page_127.shtml">15-17 kWh per 100km</a> (4 miles per kWh), which gives us a potential 80% reduction in energy demand potential for personal transportation.</p>

<p><b>Electric trains: 93% less energy</b><br>
For longer distances, such as a trip climbing, or skiing, to the Alps, from the UK. A very normal looking electric train when full, consumes only <a href="http://withouthotair.com/c20/page_119.shtml">1.6 kWh per 100 passenger-km</a>, average rail transport may be closer to 6kWh per 100 passenger-km. At 6 kWh per 100 passenger-km, taking the train requires 93% less energy than the same journey by car with one occupant. Moreover, an electric train can be powered directly from renewable electricity as it's directly linked to the electric grid by the overhead wires.</p>

<p>Perhaps an other important aspect of sustainable transport is reducing the need for transport in the first place or reducing the number of miles that we need to travel. The internet and associated web technologies makes it easier to work remotely reducing the need to commute as often. Linked in with our decisions on building design is building location and wider questions of planning. Things like the distance between housing, work and amenities and how walkable/bikeable the area is.</p>

<pre>Almost 70% of the UK's end use energy requirements are for space heating and transport, and for these two large
energy demands there exists solutions that can achieve upwards of 80% energy use reduction with no reduction in
comfort or transportation amount.</pre>

<h3>Powering up with renewable energy</h3>

<p>The remaining primary energy requirement after the large energy reductions from better building fabric, heating systems and transport are applied can then be provided by renewable energy. The Zero Carbon Britain report from the Center for Alternative Technology goes into depth on how this can be done including details on the land areas required and resoure availabilities of the different renewable energy generating technologies. The Zero Carbon Britain report also look in detail at the needs for energy storage and demand management at different timescales and it is on this work and using the ZeroCarbonBritain dataset that the next section modelling hourly energy supply and demand is built upon.</p>
