<h2>Household vs aggregation of households</h2>

<p>The models in this first series focus on household energy for traditional electricity, space heating via heatpumps and electric vehicles. While the model relates the energy quantities used to a single household the renewable generation capacity dataset, traditional electricity demand profiles and electric vehicle charging profiles are representative of an aggregation of households rather than a single household.</p>

<p>The difference between modelling on an aggregation level of hundreds or more households versus a single or couple of households is important as the smoothness of the supply and demand profiles makes it easier to achieve a higher level of matching.</p>

<p>The supply profile from onsite solar will generally be much more spiky than the supply profile for the aggregation of solar pv across a region or country as a whole. Household demand profiles from appliances, lighting, cooking and electric vehicle charging are also much more spiky on a single household basis compared to an aggregation of households.</p>

<p>When we look at ways to increase supply/demand matching is may technically more efficient to do this with an aggregation of households and generators where the demand and supply profiles are much more smooth than on a single household basis and so it is interesting to understand the solutions available on aggregate level as well as a single household level.</p>

<p>An interesting example is electric vehicle charging. Smart charging where the charging demand is varied to meet available supply could either be achieved with variable rate chargers on a household basis all adjusting their charge rates in unison to match some total supply availability, or alternativly if we say there are 200 cars all with 3kW fixed rate chargers then there is potentially 600 kW of demand that is variable in 3kW steps if the proportion of cars that are charging can be varied.</p>
