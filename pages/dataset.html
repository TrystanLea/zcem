<h2>ZeroCarbonBritain dataset</h2>

<p>The hourly energy modelling examples here uses the publicly available ZeroCarbonBritain dataset which is a hourly historical dataset for the ten year period from 00:00 on 1 January 2002 to 23:00 on 31 December 2011, this covers a total of 87,648 hours. The dataset includes carefully calculated hourly capacity factor data for onshore wind, offshore wind, wave, tidal and solar photovoltaic. It also contains hourly traditional electricity demand data.</p>

<p>The full ZeroCarbonBritain report can be downloaded <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/79311585/ZCB_TYHME_v2.xlsx">here</a> and the following dataset download is from this spreadsheet model.
