<h3>Mixed supply and mixed demand with small heat store and electric storage</h3>

<p>The last 6 examples have explored the core parts of a household zero carbon energy system model looking at supply and demand including the electrification of space heating demand and transport demand so that it can be provided for with renewable electricity.</p>

<p>This model brings all these components together to see how the combination of demands interact and how they affect the supply and demand matching.</p>

<p>It also explores the contribution of two small scale stores a 7kWh electrical store and a 10kWh heatstore.<p>

<p>The next example will bring in long term large energy stores such as power to gas in order to achieve the final 100% supply/demand matching. But the following shows how far it may be possible to go even before we take into account the available long term large capacity storage options, and other options beside such as international super grids.</p>

<p>The following table shows the results in terms of percentage of demand supplied directly of running the model on the left with different electric vehicle charging profiles, and storage options.</p>

</table>

<p>A maximum matching of 91.8% can be achieved with 7 kWh li-ion store, 10 kWh heatstore and electric car smartcharging up from a miniumum of 71.3% with no stores and night time charging only.</p>

<p>There are clearly different routes possible to achieve higher degree's of matching.</p>

<p>If smart charging is technically possible with the flexibility used within the model and that it doesnt provide too much of a burden on the user and only requires potentially a relatively small amount of electronics, embodied energy and cost compared to the li-ion store and heatstore then smart charging may be a more effective option.</p>

<p>A li-ion store and flat rate charging provides about the same benefit as smart charging and so if smart charging does not pan out to be practical then there may be an option to make up for it with a li-ion store, especially if the embodied energy and cost of storage reduces significantly.</p>

<p>The combination of measures provide decreasing gains but perhaps they provide important redundancy. It looks worthwhile to explore and develop each of the above solutions with a focus on how they integrate, the flexibility at which they can match supply, costs and embodied energy.</p>
